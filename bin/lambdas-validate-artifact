# For the terraform modules to work seamlessly from git, they
# need to refer to the lambda.zip file for the given release
# (defaulting to the latest release tag). This means that there
# are two places where the version is specified, and it is difficult
# to parameterize them without adding significat complexity
# to an already complex build process. So we have two version strings
# (bad) but this script will validate that they are the same,
# preventing PRs from being accepted until they are.
# Basically, preventing myself from shooting myself in the foot
# with this shortcut.

#Now build the final minimal docker image, and tag it
